<p>So, what it is all about? In the middle of the next year (i.e. 2020) it will be ten years since I got mine M.Sc. diploma in Computer Science and started<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> my professional career as a software developer. Hence, I decided it is a good time to stop for a moment and take a look back at the last ten years. And that&rsquo;s how this web<strong>log</strong> came to be.</p>

<p>Actually it&rsquo;s one of two reasons to put this site on the net. The second one is a more practical reason. It happened to me a few times to solve the same problem more than once. Due to the fact I couldn&rsquo;t recall anything from memory and most external web sources were blocked by security of this particular company. Very frustrating and counterproductive.</p>

<p>Most of my professional career I&rsquo;ve spent dealing with <a href="https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-businessworks">Tibco BusinessWorks BW 5</a>. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know BW 5 is part of a complete product stack for building enterprise grade EAI/ESB platforms. It&rsquo;s great and mature software directed at <em>bigish</em> enterprises, so it&rsquo;s not very popular and almost unheard of outside the enterprise world. Also what&rsquo;s more important BW 5 is sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language">VPL</a> which by defition is very often loathed by <em>normal</em> programmers. BW itself is wholly written in Java and requries JRE to run. From software develoepr perspective there is one crucial thing I have to mention, that makes this product so tempting to use. BW take ideas of reusability and <em>componentization</em> to the extreme which speeds up development by order of magnitude in comparision to standard programming languages. The trade-off is (there&rsquo;s always one) that you can&rsquo;t build, let&rsquo;s say webapps or CLI in TIBCO. Main puropse (at low level) is to provide a tool that can used to build tiny apps that consume or provide APIs which EAI is all about. One last thing if you&rsquo;re not convinced about 10x speed of developement, let me add it&rsquo;s not uncommon (telling from my experience) that BW is often last resort in delivering functionalites that can&rsquo;t be delivered by other corporate systems (CRMs, Billings and such) in reasonable timeline for given project. Sometimes it goes as far as implementing business logic on EAI. Yeah, I know it&rsquo;s terrible in terms of architecture but that&rsquo;s whole different story.</p>

<p>Least of my career I&rsquo;ve spent working with Java and other related techs. However, since the begining of 2019 I play with Spring Boot and Docker. I am very happy about it and I hope it will stay this way for a while.</p>
